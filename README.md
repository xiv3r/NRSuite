# NRSuite

> Turn a $3–5 ESP32 into a wireless research toolkit for Termux — **no root required.**

NRSuite bypasses Android's locked-down radio APIs by offloading the radio layer to an ESP32 over USB OTG, turning a stock, unrooted Android phone into a wireless research toolkit. See [Features](#features) for exactly what's implemented today. The firmware and bridge protocol are modular by design — new radio backends and capabilities register their own CMDs without touching the transport layer, so the toolkit keeps growing without becoming a single-purpose tool.

## Why this exists

Android has never exposed monitor mode, raw packet injection, or low-level radio control to user-space apps — not even with root on most devices. The traditional path required a rooted phone, a custom kernel (e.g. NetHunter), a supported external USB adapter, and a lot of luck matching hardware versions.

NRSuite sidesteps the entire problem:

- The **ESP32** handles everything radio-level — promiscuous capture, channel hopping, raw frame injection
- **Termux** talks to it over USB (native CDC or external UART bridge, depending on board) using `termux-usb` + libusb — no root, no kernel modules, no custom ROM
- The **Python bridge** speaks a compact framed binary protocol with flow control, not serial ASCII
- The **firmware and protocol are modular** — new radio backends register their own CMDs without touching the transport layer

Total hardware cost: under $5. Works on any Android phone with USB-C or micro-USB and an OTG cable.

## Features

Checklist of implemented functionality — update this when adding/removing features so it stays accurate at a glance.

- [x] **WiFi scan** — active scan with SSID, BSSID, channel, RSSI, security type
- [x] **Packet sniffing** — fixed channel or channel-hopping promiscuous capture, `.pcap` output, live stream via FIFO
- [x] **EAPOL capture** — passive handshake capture, optional BSSID/client filtering
- [x] **Deauthentication** — standalone deauth, or combined with sniffing to trigger + capture a handshake
- [x] **Captive portal / AP mode** — start/stop/status, custom SSID + channel, custom HTML upload, optional auto EAPOL capture against a target BSSID
- [x] **BLE HID (BadBLE)** — advertise as a BLE keyboard, run a DuckyScript payload against a paired host
- [x] **BLE HID (realtime keyboard)** — live keystroke passthrough from your terminal to a paired BLE host
- [x] **Heartbeat** — uptime + free heap reported every 5 seconds for health monitoring
- [ ] Beacon broadcasting (beacon spam, custom/hidden SSIDs)
- [ ] BLE scanning, advertising, device discovery, BLE spam
- [ ] Hardware expansion — IR, NRF24, CC1101 modules

> BLE HID requires a chip with a Bluetooth radio (C3, S3, or classic ESP32). ESP32-S2 is Wi-Fi only and does not support this feature — see [Hardware](#hardware).

## Hardware

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|:------:|-------|
| **ESP32-C3** | ✅ Tested | Native USB CDC, ~$3 — covers both SuperMini and regular C3 devkit boards, WiFi + BLE HID support |
| **ESP32-S3** (any board) | ✅ Tested | More RAM/flash, native USB CDC, dual-core, WiFi + BLE HID support |
| ESP32-S2 (any board) | ⚠️ Untested | Native USB (OTG), single-core, WiFi only — **no BLE radio**, so BadBLE/keyboard is unavailable on this chip regardless of testing status |
| **Classic ESP32 devkit (WROOM-32)** | ✅ Tested | Requires external USB-UART bridge on the board — no native USB CDC. CP2102, CH340, CH9102, and FTDI FT232 are explicitly supported with correct reset/init handling; other bridge chips will likely still work via generic CDC/bulk-endpoint fallback, but without guaranteed reset timing. WiFi + BLE HID support |
| USB OTG cable / adapter | — | USB-C OTG or micro-USB OTG depending on your phone |
| Android phone | — | Any version with USB host support — no root required |

NRSuite supports **both native USB CDC and external USB-UART** boards:

- **Native USB** boards (C3, S3, S2) show up as `303A:xxxx` and communicate directly over USB — no bridge chip needed. C3 uses USB-Serial-JTAG; S2 (and optionally S3) uses USB-OTG — see [build flags](#key-build-flags) for the distinction.
- **UART-based** boards (classic ESP32 devkits) use an onboard USB-to-serial chip and show up under that chip's own VID:PID. CP2102, CH340, CH9102, and FTDI FT232 are explicitly recognized (with correct reset/DTR handling); other bridge chips generally still work via a generic bulk-endpoint fallback. The bridge protocol works identically across all transports — `nrsuite` autodetects the connected device type.

The Wi-Fi module uses the ESP32's built-in 2.4 GHz radio — no external antenna needed. Future modules (NRF24, CC1101, IR) will use external add-on hardware — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies (Termux)

```bash
pkg update && pkg install python termux-api libusb
pip install pyusb
```

Also install the **Termux:API** companion app from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.api/) — *not* the Play Store version, which is outdated.

### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7wp81x/NRSuite
cd NRSuite
```

### 3. Flash the firmware

```bash
cd firmware/
pio run -e esp32-c3 --target upload   # or esp32-s3 / esp32-s2 / esp32-devkit
```

Confirm it booted correctly — `pio device monitor --baud 115200` should print `ESP32_READY`. See [Firmware](#firmware) below for pre-built binaries and `esptool.py` instructions.

### 4. Connect and run

Plug the ESP32 into your phone via OTG cable. On first run, Android shows a USB permission dialog — tap **OK**. The permission persists until you unplug.

```bash
chmod +x nrsuite
./nrsuite scan
```

**Or use the automated installer:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7wp81x/NRSuite/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Usage

All commands follow the same pattern — the script detects the USB device, requests permission via `termux-usb`, and re-invokes itself with the granted file descriptor. Wi-Fi and BLE HID are implemented so far; commands below are all `nrsuite <module-style subcommands>` under one CLI, so future modules (`ir`, ...) slot in the same way.

### Scan nearby networks

```bash
./nrsuite scan
```

```
Found device: /dev/bus/usb/002/008
Requesting USB permission (tap OK)...

```

### Capture packets

```bash
# Fixed channel
./nrsuite sniff --channel 6
./nrsuite sniff --channel 6 -o capture.pcap

# Channel hopping (stop with Ctrl+C)
./nrsuite sniff --hop --interval 300

# EAPOL-only, filtered to a target BSSID/client
./nrsuite sniff --channel 6 --eapol-only --bssid C8:3A:35:CA:75:48 --client AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Trigger deauth while sniffing, capped by count/duration
./nrsuite sniff --channel 6 --deauth --count 15 --duration 30

# Stream to a FIFO instead of writing a file
./nrsuite sniff --channel 6 --stream -o /tmp/live.pcap
```

Run `./nrsuite sniff --help` for the full flag list — options like `--count`, `--duration`, `--client`, and `--stream` combine with the modes above.

### Open in Wireshark / termshark

```bash
# Transfer the file and open on PC
wireshark capture.pcap

# Live via termshark on the phone
mkfifo /tmp/live.pcap
termshark -i /tmp/live.pcap &
./nrsuite sniff --channel 6 -o /tmp/live.pcap
```

### Capture EAPOL handshake (passive)

```bash
./nrsuite sniff --channel 6 --eapol-only --bssid C8:3A:35:CA:75:48
```

### Deauth

```bash
./nrsuite deauth \
    --bssid C8:3A:35:CA:75:48 \
    --channel 11 \
    --client FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF \ # Specific client or All client (remove)
    --count 15 \
    --interval 100
```

Sends 15 deauth frames to disconnect clients on the target BSSID. To capture the resulting EAPOL handshake at the same time, use `sniff --deauth` (see above) instead of standalone `deauth` — that combined mode is what produces a pcap usable with Hashcat or Aircrack-ng for offline WPA2 key testing.

> ⚠️ Only use this on your own network or with explicit written permission from the network owner.

### Captive portal / AP mode

```bash
./nrsuite portal start --ssid "Free WiFi" --channel 6
./nrsuite portal status
./nrsuite portal stop

# Serve a custom HTML page
./nrsuite portal start --ssid "Free WiFi" --file login.html

# Auto-capture EAPOL from a target BSSID while the portal is up
# This will also send deauth frames on target BSSID
./nrsuite portal start --ssid "Free WiFi" --bssid C8:3A:35:CA:75:48
```

> ⚠️ Only deploy a captive portal against networks/devices you own or have explicit written permission to test.

### BLE HID (BadBLE / keyboard)

> Requires a board with a Bluetooth radio — C3, S3, or classic ESP32 devkit. Not available on ESP32-S2 (WiFi-only silicon).

```bash
# Run a DuckyScript payload over BLE once a host pairs
./nrsuite ble badble --advertise "Keyboard" --payload payload.txt

# Keep advertising after the payload finishes, so you can re-trigger it
./nrsuite ble badble --advertise "Keyboard" --payload payload.txt --keep-alive

# Realtime keystroke passthrough — types whatever you type in this terminal
./nrsuite ble keyboard --advertise "Keyboard"
```

> ⚠️ Only use BLE HID injection on devices you own or have explicit written permission to test.

---

## Environments

NRSuite supports three runtime environments, detected automatically via `detect_backend()`. The same CLI commands work identically in all three.

### No root (stock Termux)

The most unique use-case. Works on any unmodified Android phone.

```
Android USB host stack
        ↓
   termux-usb  (requests permission, grants fd)
        ↓
libusb_wrap_sys_device(fd)
        ↓
   nrsuite Python
```

```bash
pkg install python termux-api libusb && pip install pyusb
# Install Termux:API from F-Droid
./nrsuite scan  # permission popup appears on first run
```

### With root (Termux + tsu/sudo)

When running as uid 0, libusb opens `/dev/bus/usb` directly — no `termux-usb`, no permission dialog, no bootstrap subprocess. Faster and simpler.

```bash
pkg install python libusb && pip install pyusb
tsu  # or: sudo ./nrsuite scan
./nrsuite scan
```

### Kali NetHunter

Works in both the NetHunter terminal (Kali chroot, root) and a Termux session running alongside it.

```bash
# In the NetHunter terminal (root)
apt update && apt install python3 python3-pip libusb-1.0-0
pip3 install pyusb
./nrsuite scan

# Note: if cdc_acm claimed the interface, nrsuite detaches it automatically
```

### Backend summary

| Environment | uid | USB access |
|---|:---:|---|
| Stock Termux (no root) | 1000 | `termux-usb` → `libusb_wrap_sys_device(fd)` |
| Termux + root (tsu/sudo) | 0 | libusb → `/dev/bus/usb` directly |
| NetHunter terminal | 0 | libusb → `/dev/bus/usb` directly |
| NetHunter + Termux (no root) | 1000 | `termux-usb` → `libusb_wrap_sys_device(fd)` |

Detection is fully automatic — no `--root` flag or manual configuration needed.

## Firmware

### Supported boards

| Board | `platformio.ini` env | Transport | VID:PID | Status |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|:-------:|:------:|
| ESP32-C3 | `esp32-c3` | Native USB CDC | `303A:1001` | ✅ Tested |
| ESP32-S3 | `esp32-s3` | Native USB CDC | `303A:1001` | ✅ Tested |
| ESP32-S2 | `esp32-s2` | Native USB (OTG) | `303A:0002` | ⚠️ Untested |
| Classic ESP32 devkit (WROOM-32) | `esp32-devkit` | External USB-UART (CP2102/CH340) | chip-dependent | ✅ Tested |

### Key build flags

USB-Serial-JTAG boards (C3, S3):

```ini
build_flags =
    -DARDUINO_USB_MODE=1           ; route Serial to the USB-Serial-JTAG peripheral
    -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1    ; enable CDC before setup() runs  ← CRITICAL
    -DCONFIG_AUTOSTART_ARDUINO=1   ; loop() won't run without this
    -DCONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_SNIFFER=1
```

USB-OTG boards (S2 — and S3 if you prefer OTG mode over JTAG-Serial):

```ini
build_flags =
    -DARDUINO_USB_MODE=0           ; S2 has no USB-Serial-JTAG peripheral — must use OTG/TinyUSB
    -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1    ; enable CDC before setup() runs  ← CRITICAL
    -DCONFIG_AUTOSTART_ARDUINO=1
    -DCONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_SNIFFER=1
```

> **`ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1` is critical on both native-USB variants** — without it `Serial` maps to UART0 (TX/RX pins) instead of native USB, and the bridge protocol gets no data over the OTG cable.

> `ARDUINO_USB_MODE` controls *which* native USB peripheral `Serial` binds to — `1` = USB-Serial-JTAG (only present on C3/S3/C6/H2 silicon), `0` = USB-OTG/TinyUSB (present on S2/S3). Setting `MODE=1` on a chip without the JTAG-Serial peripheral (like S2) causes a build error (`'HWCDCSerial' was not declared in this scope`) since that class was never compiled in for that chip.

External USB-UART boards (classic ESP32 devkit — no native USB peripheral at all):

```ini
build_flags =
    -DARDUINO_USB_MODE=0            ; no native USB peripheral on classic ESP32
    -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=0     ; Serial routes to UART0, out through the onboard CP2102/CH340
    -DCONFIG_AUTOSTART_ARDUINO=1
    -DCONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_SNIFFER=1
```

The bridge protocol and every CMD work identically across all three configurations — the only difference is the physical/USB layer. `nrsuite` autodetects which one is connected.

### Flashing with PlatformIO

```bash
cd firmware/

# Flash + open serial monitor
pio run -e esp32-c3 --target upload && pio device monitor

# Confirm boot — should print: ESP32_READY
# Heartbeat JSON appears every 5s: {"uptime":5000,"heap":250336,"type":"heartbeat"}
```

### Flashing pre-built binaries

Pre-built `.bin` files are on the [Releases](https://github.com/7wp81x/nrsuite/releases) page.

#### From a PC / laptop

```bash
pip install esptool

esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0 nrsuite-esp32c3.bin
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0 nrsuite-esp32s3.bin
esptool.py --chip esp32s2 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0 nrsuite-esp32s2.bin
esptool.py --chip esp32   --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0 nrsuite-esp32-generic.bin
```

No Python environment handy? Espressif also runs a browser-based flasher that works over WebSerial — no install required, just Chrome/Edge and a USB cable:

- [ESP Web Flasher](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) — drag in the `.bin`, pick the offset (`0x0`), flash from the browser
- [ESP32 Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools) — Windows GUI alternative

#### From Android only (Termux, no root)

`esptool.py` depends on pyserial, which expects a `/dev/ttyUSB*` node — Android doesn't expose one to unrooted apps, so plain `esptool.py` **will not work** in stock Termux. Use [Termux-ESP-Flasher](https://github.com/7wp81x/Termux-ESP-Flasher) instead. A Termux-native flasher that talks to the USB endpoints directly (same `termux-usb` fd-wrapping approach NRSuite itself uses), with no root and no pyserial required:

```bash
pkg update && pkg install python termux-api libusb
pip install pyusb
```

Install the **Termux:API** companion app from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.api/) — *not* the Play Store version, which is outdated.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7wp81x/Termux-ESP-Flasher
cd Termux-ESP-Flasher
chmod +x nrflash

# Auto-detects the chip — omit --chip unless you want to force it
./nrflash write --offset 0x0 nrsuite-esp32c3.bin

# Flash + verify against the device afterward
./nrflash write --offset 0x0 nrsuite-esp32c3.bin --verify
```

See the [NRFlasher README](https://github.com/7wp81x/NRFlasher) for multi-file writes (bootloader + partitions + app in one session), baud auto-negotiation, and troubleshooting.

---

## Bridge Protocol

NRSuite uses a compact binary framing protocol over the serial link (native USB CDC bulk transfer, or a UART bridge chip depending on board). It's transport for the whole suite, not just Wi-Fi — BLE HID already reuses it, and future modules (IR, NRF24, CC1101) will add their own CMD types on top of the same framing.

```
[0xAD 0xDE][TYPE 1B][ID 1B][LENGTH 4B LE][PAYLOAD NB]
```

| Type | Hex | Direction | Payload |
|------|:---:|-----------|---------|
| CMD | `0x01` | Termux → ESP32 | JSON `{"cmd": "...", "args": {...}}` |
| RESP | `0x02` | ESP32 → Termux | JSON response, same ID as CMD |
| EVENT | `0x03` | ESP32 → Termux | JSON async event (scan results, heartbeat) |
| PCAP | `0x04` | ESP32 → Termux | Raw binary: radiotap header + 802.11 frame |
| ACK | `0x05` | Termux → ESP32 | JSON `{"chunk": N}` — flow control |

PCAP frames use sliding-window flow control: the ESP32 buffers up to `SNIFF_MAX_INFLIGHT` (default 4) unacknowledged frames before pausing.

### Supported CMDs (Wi-Fi module)

| CMD | Args | Response |
|-----|------|----------|
| `PING` | — | `{"ok": true, "msg": "pong"}` |
| `STATUS` | — | `{"ok": true, "uptime": ms, "heap": bytes, "chip": "...", "sniffing": bool}` |
| `SCAN_WIFI` | — | `{"ok": true, "count": N}` + N `scan_ap` events |
| `START_SNIFF` | `{"mode": "fixed"\|"hop", "channel": 1-13, ...}` | `{"ok": true}` |
| `STOP_SNIFF` | — | `{"ok": true, "captured": N, "sent": N, "dropped": N}` |
| `DEAUTH` | `{"bssid": "...", "channel": N, "count": N, ...}` | `{"ok": true, "sent": N}` |
| `DEAUTH_CAPTURE` | same as DEAUTH | `{"ok": true, "sent": N, "sniffing": true}` |

### Supported CMDs (BLE HID module)

> Only available on boards with a Bluetooth radio (C3, S3, classic ESP32 devkit). Not compiled in on ESP32-S2 builds — that chip has no Bluetooth radio.

| CMD | Args | Response |
|-----|------|----------|
| `BLE_BEGIN` | `{"name": "..."}` | `{"ok": true}` |
| `BLE_STATUS` | — | `{"ok": true, "connected": bool, "advertising": bool, "peer": "..."}` |
| `BLE_RUN_SCRIPT` | `{"script": "...DuckyScript text..."}` | `{"ok": true, "lines": N}` |
| `BLE_KEY_DOWN` | `{"key": "..."}` | `{"ok": true}` |
| `BLE_KEY_UP` | `{"key": "..."}` | `{"ok": true}` |
| `BLE_STOP` | — | `{"ok": true}` |
| `BLE_END` | — | `{"ok": true}` |
